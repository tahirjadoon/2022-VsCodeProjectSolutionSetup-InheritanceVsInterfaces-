- Inheritance is not code sharing
- Is-a relationship
- Need to share common logic
- Sharing just properties or method signature is not enough
- Inheritance can put you in a corner
- You need to ask the question: What is the point?

We have cornered ourselves with II.Library.FaultyOO implementation
1. Style so moved it to RentalCars and RentalTruck. Removed for RetalBoat and RentalSailBoat
2. StartEngine and StopEngine do not apply to RentalSailBoat. So made these virtual and override 
	with throw exception in RentalSailBoat. Which means we'll need to check the implementation throuhut the code to check for the object with "is"
	
A better approach is detailed in II.Library.BetterOO implementation
